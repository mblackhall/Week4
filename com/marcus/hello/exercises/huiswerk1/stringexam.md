##String question

```java
String s1 = "spring ";
String s2 = s1 + "summer ";
s1.concat("fall ");
s2.concat(s1);
s1 += "winter ";
System.out.println(s1 + " " + s2);
```
What is the output? For extra credit, how many String objects and how many
reference variables were created prior to the println statement?
